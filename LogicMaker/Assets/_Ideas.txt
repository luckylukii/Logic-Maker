1. IDEA FOR CUSTOM CHIP SYSTEM:

Every toggle/light acts as input and output
Toggle will have a bool called isEditing, which controls if its PowerState is controlled by a pin (off) or the mouse (on)
Light will have the same bool that controls if the output is displayed with a graphic (on) or outputs to a pin (off)

IDEA FOR IMPLEMENTING: 
Maybe experiment with subscenes/creating a gameObject with all the chips in the scene, then clear the scene
(could just move all chips from the scene into the new chip, then save it somehow for later and then delete the chip)

SUMMARY:
bool isEditing -> true: pins; false: mouse/graphic
move scene items to new chip => save chip => delete chip instance
